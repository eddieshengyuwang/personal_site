<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;"> I'm an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at
  the University of Waterloo and Business Administration at Wilfrid Laurier University in Canada.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
  I was also previously an exchange student at &Eacute;cole polytechnique f&#233;d&#233;rale de Lausanne (EPFL) in
  Switzerland.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
  Within computer science, I'm especially interested in machine learning applications in computer vision.
  Within business, I'm particularly fascinated by digital and social media marketing.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
  My hobbies include playing tennis, making videos, and (attempting in) learning new languages.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
  Always down to vibe about tennis, cameras, and Kanye West. &#x270C</p>
