<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Daniil Medvedev had a breakthrough season in 2019. The 23 year old Russian started the year ranked 16 in the world but towards the end of the year won 2 Masters titles and made it to the finals of the US Open (where he lost to Nadal) to end the season ranked world number 5.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
One interesting thing you’ll notice about Medvedev is his ice-cold demeanor on the tennis court. He rarely reacts negatively or positively to any point he plays or to any outcome of the match. Take a look at his reaction after winning the Shanghai Rolex Masters this year:

This guy just won a Masters title (one of the more prestigious tournaments) and gained $1.4 million in his bank account but he acted like it was just another regular win. That’s quite different from the usual reactions from players who won their tournaments: </p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
Yet Medvedev’s demeanor on the court suggests that winning is routine for him. That it’s not over for him and there are many more titles yet to come his way. I think the tennis world is excited to see how this man progresses with his career.</p>
