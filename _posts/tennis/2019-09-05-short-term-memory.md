<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;"> More often than not, a tennis match is lost by one player rather than won by the other. A player wins not by hitting more <b>winners</b> (an un-returned shot) and overpowering their opponent (though in some situations that is the case). Rather a player loses by usually making more mistakes, such as hitting the ball out or in the net, that seem to just come from out of the blue.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;"> This is called an <b>unforced error</b>. Unforced errors are extremely common in the sport; plenty of them committed in a single match ranging from beginners to professionals. Because making unforced errors are inevitable in the sport, it is crucial to know how to handle these mistakes and move on past them. One such technique is to instill a short term memory loss. Forget about the last point you played and focus on the next. </p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
But why? </p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
Because once you start thinking, your body gets tight, your strokes become heavy, and you dwell more and more about the immutable past – all of which hinder your physical and mental states for peak performance.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
Okay, so how?
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
Arguably it is easier to get over a spectacular opponent winner or forced error, you can applaud the shot and say “there is nothing I can do about that”. It is much tougher to move on from the unforced errors. If you are feeling frustrated, make sure to let out all the emotions before the start of the next point. Then forget, concentrate purely on the ball and maintain a calm mind for whatever comes next. Easier said than done!</p>
