<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">One thing people will describe about Roger Federer’s game is that he is effortless on the court. His footwork is graceful in gliding to all of his shots and his hitting strokes are loose like an elastic.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
Federer generates an incredible amount of power in all his shots. But ironically, he can only do so by <b>not trying to hit with a lot of power</b>. Instead, it’s through relaxing the arms and body in which a tennis player actually generates more force in his or her shot. </p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><i>This seems counter-intuitive, how can someone hit harder… by not trying to hit harder? </i></p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
Often when players try to hit harder, they grip the racket hard, flex their muscles tight, and try to muscle their shot. But less energy is actually transferred to the ball as opposed to maintaining a loose grip, relaxing the arms, and swinging freely. As a simple experiment, try to move your wrists as fast as you can, first by clenching your fist and flexing the wrist hard. Next relax your hand and wrist and flop it around. Although it’s a silly example, it demonstrates how relaxed movement generates a more kinetic energy compared to the rigid, hard movements.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
Therefore, if you’re trying to achieve a more powerful stroke, perhaps concentrate less on actually trying to hit harder. Instead, relax and hit freely and you may (paradoxically) find that only through letting go of trying too hard is how you’ll ultimately end up achieving your goal!
