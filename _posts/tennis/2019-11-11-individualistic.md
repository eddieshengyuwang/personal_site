<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">In his autobiography <i>Open</i>, 8-time Grand Slam champion Andre Agassi described tennis as the loneliest sport men and women can play:</p>

>“Only boxers can understand the loneliness of tennis players - and yet boxers have their corner men and managers. Even a boxer's opponent provides a kind of companionship, someone he can grapple with and grunt at. In tennis you stand face-to-face with the enemy, trade blows with him, but never touch him or talk to him, or anyone else. The rules forbid a tennis player from even talking to his coach while on the court. People sometimes mention the track-and-field runner as a comparably lonely figure, but I have to laugh. At least the runner can feel and smell his opponents. They're inches away. In tennis you're on an island. Of all the games men and women play, tennis is the closest to solitary confinement...”

Individualism and self-reliance are distinct features found predominantly in tennis compared to other sports (and though there are doubles in tennis, they are not nearly as celebrated or glorified enough compared to singles, especially at the professional level). For example, there are no teammates, no caddies, no coaches, no friends for Novak Djokovic to turn to on court during a 5 hour Wimbledon match - he has to figure out everything on his own. </p>

There are pros and cons to this in my opinion. For one, a player can largely build his/her skills of being independent, which fits hand-in-hand with the (North) American individualistic culture. On the other hand (and this may be a big generalization), <b>I’ve observed that tennis players are some of the most loneliest and introverted people out there</b> throughout my years playing juniors up until now. </p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
Personally, I find it very hard to rely on other people and I much rather prefer to do things all on my own*. And I don’t think this is by coincidence, I think it’s because I spent many years playing a sport that breeds a mentality in which I am 100% responsible for all my victories and I am 100% responsible for all my losses. Overall, depending on your perspective, that can be a good or bad thing. </p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
Nonetheless, there are some noticeable trends picking up in professional tennis that emphasize more collectivism. The Laver Cup, introduced in 2016, pits two teams (Europe vs. World) against each other, with the format allowing teammates and coaches to provide on-court consultations. Another team based event, called the ATP Cup, is set to premiere in January 2020. In this year's ATP Next Gen Finals, new innovations were experimented which included on-court coaching, with the hope that it will eventually transfer over to the main ATP Tour. And while there are some purists who believe that tennis should remain grind-it-out-on-your-own style, I am excited to see how the sport evolves to combat some of the loneliness out there. &#x1F642; </p>
