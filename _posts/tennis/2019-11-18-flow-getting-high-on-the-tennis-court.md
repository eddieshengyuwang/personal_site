<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">There is a certain feeling you get when you are “in the zone” on the court. Your senses become heightened, the ball seems to travel in slow motion, and you move fluidly to all the positions before hitting a clean shot. It’s a sort of a <i>high</i> feeling you get on the tennis court. Psychologists call this state as being in the “flow” and it’s during this state that a player feels and performs the best. It’s a state in which nothing seems to bother the player as he/she freely hits the ball and enjoys their time on court. Here are three tips that I found are helpful for me to get induced into the flow state:</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;"> <b> 1. Concentrating on the seams of the ball and watching your contact point </b></p>

 <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;"> The seams are the white lines marked on the tennis ball. By laser focusing your eyes on the seams of the ball, I find that I am able to better judge where the ball is going to land on my side of the court and it prevents my mind from wandering off to other places. Instead, I am locked into the present moment and purely focused on hitting the ball. And when I do hit the ball, I try to see and focus exactly where on the racket the ball makes contact. This further helps me “feel” how I’m hitting the ball and get in tune with the rhythm of the game. </p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;"> <b> 2. Counting numbers in between points and changeovers </b></p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;"> In between points and changeovers are the most vulnerable times in which your mind can start wandering, since you’re not in the heat of the moment moving around and hitting balls. Often these are the times in which I start thinking, for example if I am down during the match I’ll start to think: “what are my teammates going to think of me if I lose this?”, or if I’m up I’ll think: “what am I going to say to console my opponent at the net after this W?”, or just randomly anytime I might think: “what’s for dinner today?” It is very easy for thoughts to come up but <b>they serve no purpose other than to take you out of the flow.</b> Thus, I like to fill these empty moments by immediately counting numbers until I play the next point. That way I replace thoughts such as “how could I have missed that shot?!” with “1, 2, 3,…”, which helps me preserve my state of being in the flow. </p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;"> <b> 3.	No reactions after a point </b></p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;"> This one is tricky because it is hard to not celebrate after winning an incredible point or chastise yourself after making an unforced error. For some people, like the legendary John McEnroe, they thrive on emotional outbursts to keep them engaged in the match. Even for me, I play great tennis when I pump myself up and let out a “CMON!!!!!!” after winning a point. However, when I reflect on some of the best matches I’ve played, my peak performances have been when I didn’t react to <b>anything</b> that happened on the court, regardless of winning or losing a point. This “ice” style of play that Bjorn Borg and Roger Federer elect to use heavily contrasts John McEnroe’s “fire” style of play, but it’s the one that I personally find to be the most effective in maintaining the state of flow. </p>
