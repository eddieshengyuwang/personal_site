<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;"> Recently, I’ve been finding myself struggling to control my negative thoughts on the tennis court. It almost seems like a habit to somehow exhibit some sort of reaction every time I hit the ball into the net or out of bounds. But something that helped me gain a new perspective on the court was an argument made in the book <i>The Inner Game of Tennis</i> by Timothy Galloway along the lines of there <b> being no good or bad shot.</b></p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;"> One of the most important things to do in competition is to empty the mind, enter the <i>flow</i>, and just play. This is easier said than done, especially with judgmental thoughts constantly labeling each point as being good or bad. When the mind believes a shot is bad, it will think about how to fix it (should I drop my racket head lower? Or bend my knees more?). When the mind believes a shot is good, it will ponder on how you hit such a great shot, leading it to think and try hard in emulating the stroke. The next thing you know, muscles are tightening, the mind starts to fill with thoughts, and the player is carried away from an ideal, relaxed state. </p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
Instead, observe what is occurring on the court with a non-judgmental mindset. For example, there is a difference between saying “you are hitting the net too often this game” in an impartial tone vs. “you just can’t seem to get the ball over the net can’t you? Do you even know how to play???” stated in an angry fashion.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
To conclude this post, I’ll reference one of my favourite passages from Galloway’s book:</p>

> “The image comes to my mind of the balanced movement of a leopard stalking a bird. **Effortlessly alert**, he crouches, gathering his **relaxed** muscles for the spring. **No thinking** about when to jump, nor how he will push off with his hind legs to attain the proper distance, **his mind is still** and perfectly concentrated on his prey. No thought flashes into his consciousness of the possibility or consequences of missing his mark. He sees only bird. Suddenly the bird takes off; at the same instant, the cat leaps. With perfect anticipation he intercepts his dinner two feet off the ground. Perfectly, **thoughtlessly executed action**, and afterward, no self-congratulations, just the reward inherent in his action: the bird in the mouth.”
