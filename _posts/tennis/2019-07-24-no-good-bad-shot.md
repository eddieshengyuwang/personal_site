<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;"> Recently, I’ve been finding myself struggling to control my negative thoughts on the tennis court. It almost seems like a habit to somehow exhibit some sort of reaction every time I hit the ball into the net or out of bounds. But something that helped me gain a new perspective on the court was an argument made in the book The Inner Game of Tennis by Timothy Galloway along the lines of there <b> being no good or bad shot in tennis. </b></p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;"> One of the most important things to do in tennis competition is to empty the mind, enter the flow, and just play. This is easier said than done, especially with judgemental thoughts constantly labelling each point as being good or bad. When the mind believes a shot is bad, it will think about how to fix it (should I bend drop my racket head lower? Or bend my knees more?). When the mind believes a shot is good, it will ponder on how you hit such a great shot, leading it to think and try hard in emulating the stroke. The next thing you know, muscles are tightening, the mind starts to fill with thoughts, and the player is carried away from an ideal, relaxed state. </p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
To conclude this post, I’ll reference one of my favourite passages from Galloway’s book:</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
“The image comes to my mind of the balanced movement of a leopard stalking a bird. Effortlessly alert, he crouches, gathering his relaxed muscles for the spring. No thinking about when to jump, nor how he will push off with his hind legs to attain the proper distance, his mind is still and perfectly concentrated on his prey. No thought flashes into his consciousness of the possibility or consequences of missing his mark. He sees only bird. Suddenly the bird takes off; at the same instant, the cat leaps. With perfect anticipation he intercepts his dinner two feet off the ground. Perfectly, thoughtlessly executed action, and afterward, no self-congratulations, just the reward inherent in his action: the bird in the mouth.”</p>
