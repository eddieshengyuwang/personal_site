<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">You’ll notice many peculiarities about Rafael Nadal when he plays on the tennis court.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
You’ll notice that he always steps over the lines with his right foot.

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
You’ll notice that his two water bottles need to be perfectly aligned diagonally with the labels facing towards his court.

And of course you’ll notice his hair straightening, nose wiping, and the (infamous) tugging of his pants before he serves.

You’ll think that this guy is suffering from some mad OCD. You’ll think that this guy has some mad superstitions. But what does Nadal have to say about his peculiarities?
</p>

>“I put the two bottles down at my feet, in front of my chair to my left, one neatly behind the other, diagonally aimed at the court. Some call it superstition, but it’s not. If it were superstition, why would I keep doing the same thing over and over whether I win or lose? It’s a way of placing myself in a match, ordering my surroundings to match the order I seek in my head.”

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
So yes, perhaps Nadal’s eccentrics may be excessive in the eyes of others. But Nadal doesn’t regard it as so, and it certainly helps keep him mentally engaged. Better to keep those rituals and win 19 Grand Slams (and potentially counting!) rather than not having them at all, no?
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
<i>But isn’t that just his routine? What distinguishes a ritual from being a routine?</i>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
Growing up, I was always taught to perform a pre-serve ritual. My coach never deemed it a “routine”. The reason being is that a ritual has an element of <b>meaning</b> behind it. Bouncing the ball 7 times before you serve can very well be a routine if done mindlessly, but if bouncing the ball 7 times calms you down mentally, keeps your focus fixated on the ball, and structures your mind and body for the next point then that can be considered a ritual.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
A ritual doesn’t have to be as intense or regimen as Nadal’s. Novak Djokovic’s ritual is to bounce the ball many, many times before an important point. Bianca Andreescu uses a combination of meditation, yoga and visualization as her ritual before she goes out to play every match. Basketball players also go through a set of steps to engage themselves before shooting a free throw.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
So think about adding some rituals into your life. Or add some meaning towards a current routine to turn it into a ritual. Perhaps by establishing some meaningful consistency, you’ll find that it’ll help keep you grounded and engaged day by day!
